TechBikers was born in 2012 from Google Campus in London as a means for the tech community to put down their laptops and pick up a bike to support charity, network, share ideas and spread the start-up vibe. Behind TechBikers was Eze Vidra, Benjamin Southworth, and Mark Jennings. Their work allowed to donate over £700,000 to charity.

In 2022, [Emmanuel Nataf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuelnataf/){:target="\_blank"} (Co-Founder of Reedsy), decided to revive the community. A first ride from [Faro to Lisbon](/rides/faro-to-lisbon-2022) in September 2022, allowed to raise £70,000, enabling Room to Read to expand into two new school communities. Our goal is to enable many other rides to happen in the future.

To ensure that the maximum amount of money reaches [Room to Read](https://www.roomtoread.org/){:target="\_blank"}, the charity, we cover some of our ride costs with sponsorship.

If you work in tech, enjoying cycling and want to make a tangible impact on millions of children and their community, [sign up to our newsletter](http://eepurl.com/iaST0v){:target="\_blank"} and consider joining our rides!
