TechBikers was born in 2012 from Google Campus in London as a means for the tech community to put down their laptops and pick up a bike to support charity, network, share ideas and spread the start-up vibe. Behind TechBikers was Eze Vidra, Benjamin Southworth, and Abraham Choi. Their work allowed to donate over £700,000 to charity.

In 2022, [Emmanuel Nataf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuelnataf/) (Founder of Reedsy), [Eduardo Paperini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardopaperini) (Investor at Breed Reply), [Miguel Martinez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelmalvarez) (Founder of SignalAI), and [Harry Rhys Davies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harryrhysdavies) (Chief of Staff at Greyparrot), decided to revive the TechBikers community. We will be doing our first ride, from [Faro to Lisbon](/rides/faro-to-lisbon-2022) in September.

To ensure that the maximum amount of money reaches the charity, we cover some of our ride costs with sponsorship, and that presents some exciting, and tangible reasons to get involved
