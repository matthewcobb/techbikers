TechBikers was born in 2012 from Google Campus in London as a means for the tech community to put down their laptops and pick up a bike to support charity, network, share ideas and spread the start-up vibe. Behind TechBikers was Eze Vidra, Benjamin Southworth, and Abraham Choi. Their work allowed to donate over Â£300,000 to charity.

In 2022, we decided to revive the TechBikers community and will be doing our first ride, from [Faro to Lisbon]({% link _rides/lisbon-to-faro.md %}) in September.

To ensure that the maximum amount of money reaches the charity, we cover our ride costs with sponsorship, and that presents some exciting, and tangible reasons to get involved.
