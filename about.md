TechBikers was born in 2012 from Google Campus in London as a means for the tech community to put down their laptops and pick up a bike to support charity, network, share ideas and spread the start-up vibe. Behind TechBikers was Eze Vidra, Benjamin Southworth, and Abraham Choi. Their work allowed to donate over Â£700,000 to charity.

In 2022, Emmanuel Nataf ([Reedsy](https://reedsy.com)), Eduardo Paperini ([Breed Reply](https://www.reply.com/breed-reply/en/)), Miguel Martinez (Founder of [SignalAI](https://www.signal-ai.com)), and Harry Rhys Davies ([Greyparrot](https://www.greyparrot.ai)), decided to revive the TechBikers community. We will be doing our first ride, from [Faro to Lisbon]({% link _rides/lisbon-to-faro.md %}) in September.

To ensure that the maximum amount of money reaches the charity, we cover some of our ride costs with sponsorship, and that presents some exciting, and tangible reasons to get involved
