The first version was published on a free-but-donate, effectively on the basis that you made a donation to Resurgo Spear if you enjoyed it. In that spirit, it will continue to be freely available (although some of the examples are now dated).

If you enjoy it, please do consider [making a donation](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/fundraisingfieldguide-charity-3) to Resurgo’s Spear Programme.
